🍏 A.G.S (Avocado Grading System)
🔍 Overview
A.G.S is a real-time spectral-driven classification system leveraging decision algorithms for seamless fruit grading. Designed for precision & efficiency, the system automates sorting, minimizing waste and optimizing supply chain logistics. 🚀

🛠 Core Workflow
🔋 Power Init: Ensures stable energy flow to all components.
🚥 Conveyor Dispatch: Fruits enter the grading zone via a controlled belt mechanism.
📡 Spectral Sensing: Real-time data acquisition extracts key parameters.
🧠 Decision Circuit: Random Forest (RF) classifier evaluates ripeness levels.
⚙️ Motorized Sorting: Actuated gear systems direct fruits to their respective bins.
📦 Quality Output: Optimized selection ensures premium-grade produce.
🏗 Tech Stack
